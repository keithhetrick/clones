google-docs-clone

A Full-Stack app clone of Goggle Docs built with React, Node.js, MongoDB & Socket.io

The app can edit documents across multiple screens, in real time, and have to changes appear in all the other screens with the same URL. It also stores document data in a database, so you can close the app & have your data persist until you open the document back up
